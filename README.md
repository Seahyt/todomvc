# React TodoMVC Practice

## My Learning Plan

1. **Good Intro to what React is (React is often described as declarative):** https://medium.freecodecamp.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming-283e96bf8aea#.7tqz37tbu

2. **Learn Raw React: Reading through the first page will give you a sufficiently good understanding of what Raw React (without JSX) is. Might not need to cover the second page if you are running short on time)** http://jamesknelson.com/learn-raw-react-no-jsx-flux-es6-webpack/

2) **CodeSchool - ES6 Powering up with React has a really good beginner friendly tutorial**
https://www.codeschool.com/courses/powering-up-with-react

3) **React JS Program: Unfortunately, the free tutorial covers react in ES5 but it is good for beginners and gives a good overview of core principles plus a clear explanation of webpack** http://www.reactjsprogram.com/


### At this point we should be ready for the official docs!
